Grade Scaler calculates adaptive grading scales and presents graphical exam statistics. Since exams change from semester to semester, the grading scheme, sometimes, has to be adapted to account for, e.g., overly hard exam questions. Grade Scaler transforms a list of exam points into a corresponding grade mapping by applying a variable exam passing limit (Base) and a variable best grade limit (Roof).
